Topic 2: Uninformed Search

In Week 1 we represented a problem as states and actions.

This week we will explore a state space using:

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS),
2. Depth-First Search (DFS).

----------------------------------------------------
YOUR TASKS

Task 1:
    Complete the BFS algorithm

Task 2:
    Complete the DFS algorithm

Task 3:
    Compare the paths returned

Task 4:
    Explain the differences between BFS and DFS

Be prepared to discuss:

2. What data structure does DFS use?

3. Why does BFS usually return a shorter path?

4. Which algorithm explores more states?
